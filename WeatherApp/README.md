<h3>Introduction</h3>

I came across a highly practical exercise on YouTube, which I found to be immensely helpful. Following the instructions provided in the tutorial, I noticed significant improvement. This exercise, outlined in the video, is not only easy to understand but also remarkably effective in enhancing skills. The presenter's clear and concise way of explaining concepts made the learning process enjoyable and engaging. By incorporating these methods into my routine, I have observed noticeable progress.

The Weather App is a Java-based application that provides users with real-time weather information for a specified location. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays it in a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can enter a location, and the app retrieves and presents weather details, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. This documentation outlines the project's architecture, technologies used, and the functionality of each class within the application.
